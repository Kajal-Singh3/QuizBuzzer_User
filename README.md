#  Quiz Buzzer app

Most schools either do not do buzzer
rounds in quiz competitions because
they do not have the buzzer machine
or they purchase/rent expensive
hardware or they adopt error prone
methods.
In this app four different
teams will press a buzzer on their
phones and we will know the order  in
which they pressed the buzzer.
